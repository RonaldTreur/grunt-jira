# grunt-jira

> JIRA intergration for Grunt

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-jira --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-jira');
```

## Thanks

Thanks to Vincent "@shift" Palmer for handing over the reins of this plugin!

*Please note*
Though the original code-base by @shift has served as the starting point for the new version of this plugin, little of it (if at all) remains. Most of it was rewritten and severely extended in order to support additional Jira functions. 

**BREAKING CHANGES**
Starting with v0.2.0 the interaction with this plugin has changed drastically and your old configuration won't work anymore. 

## The "jira" task

Stay tuned for updated instructions on how to use the new grunt-jira plugin!

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
