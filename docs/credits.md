This grunt task was originally created by Vincent "@shift" Palmer. It was created for the sole purpose of creating new version for Jira projects. Unfortunately it saw little activity after its initial unveiling and was never extended to include more functionality. After the project had slumbered for well over a year, I (Ronald Treur) asked him if I could take over and continue the good work. He graceously complied with this request, so many thanks to @shift for taking the first steps and for passing on the torch!

***Please note***
Though the original code-base by @shift has served as the starting point for the current version of this plugin, little of it (if at all) remains. Most of it was rewritten and severely extended in order to support additional Jira functionality. 

The result of this is that that version 0.2 and later are **not backwards compatible** with any prior version.
